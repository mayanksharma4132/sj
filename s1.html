    A special anti-terror court on Monday acquitted accused Swami Aseemanand and four others in the Mecca Masjid blast case, holding that the prosecution failed to prove "even a single allegation" against them. The Mecca Masjid attack was allegedly carried out by a group of right-wing terrorists 11 years ago on May 18, 2007.
    Barely hours after pronouncing the judgement, in a dramatic development, K Ravinder Reddy, the special judge for NIA cases, tendered his resignation, citing "personal" reasons. Reddy said his resignation had nothing to do with today's judgement, according to a senior judicial officer.
    "He has sent the resignation letter to MSJ...he has cited personal grounds and it has nothing to do with today's verdict in the Mecca Masjid blast case," the senior judicial officer told PTI, speaking on condition of anonymity.
    Reddy, had apparently taken the decision to resign sometime back itself, the officer said.
    The explosion ripped through the mosque on May 18, 2007. Two live improvised explosive devices (IEDs) were also recovered by police and defused. Later, five more people were killed in subsequent police firing on a crowd outside the mosque.
    There were a total of eight accused in the case. One accused, Sunil Joshi, an RSS spokesperson, was murdered during the course of the investigation. Two other accused, Sandeep V Dange and Ramchandra Kalsangra, both RSS activists, still elude the investigators.
    Apart from Aseemanand, those acquitted are â€” Devendra Gupta, Lokesh Sharma, Bharat Mohanlal Rateshwar alias Bharat Bhai and Rajendra Chowdhary.
    According to Aseemanand's counsel Sharma, the court after examining documents and material placed on record found that the charges did not stick.
    "This entire case was based on the confessional statement of Swami Aseemanand. Right from the beginning, we had been placing before the court that this is not the statement of confession.
    "The defence argued that the so-called confessional statement was forced from Swami Aseemanand in order to create a theory of 'Bhagwa Atankwad' (saffron terror)," he said.
    The court, Sharma said, held that the confessional statement of Aseemanand was not voluntary. "CBI had got the statement of Swami Aseemanand recorded in Delhi while he was in police custody during December 2010," he said.
